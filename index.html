  <h1><p>The problem with go gaurdian infecting FBISD laptops</p></h1>
<p>
  (Of course it may seem logical to protect your own property, but this raises many ethical questions affecting naive students fully unaware of what go guardian does )  us students dont have an alternative as we arent allowed to bring personal devices to use instead of these laptops 
  the 1:1 program was started about a year ago and even at the start there has been many concerns of privacy and safety. 
  the program was meant to give equal oppurtunity but in my opinion (do NOT say in my opinion, be professional and back your own words) it is just a way to control us and moniter us. 
  there could have been many factors to influence this program and the downloading of tracking software but no matter the reason it is not okay. (Maybe you could discuss ethical problems)

  The collection of mine and many other kids(say students, don’t say mine, you should try to represent students not yourself) data/ information is not okay and i along with many other students will not stand for the injustice of it. 

  we are forced to log in to our personal accounts for some classes work making it harder and harder to protect ourselves from these effects of the app. 
  and without an alternative to these laptops we have no choice but to let the district siphone our information 

  these ideas are given an even worse image when the district suffers cyber attacks showing that our data isnt even secure and is just loosely flung as no worth in to the cyberspace
